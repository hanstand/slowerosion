She was selected as a participant in the Choreographic Coding Lab through Motion-Bank at UCLA. Hannah has collaborated with sculpture artist Sarah Fetterman and their installations and durational work have been presented at the Center on Contemporary Art (CoCA), Hybrid Arc Gallery, and SOIL Gallery.

		<p class="statement">My practice, with movement at its heart, utilizes technology and unusual materials to explore intangible and ephemeral states of being. I develop a logical framework to unearth and preserve those things that are slippery, elusive; those things that are hard to hold, hard to name, harder yet to understand. My process is careful and intricate, approaching these liminal states with a reverence, logic, and curiosity. I work to translate the ephemeral into artifact; to slow the process of disappearance; to keep a record of the residues that we leave. I want to understand: How heavy is loneliness? Does a memory taste sweet? How soft is grief? What is the texture of a ghost?</p>
