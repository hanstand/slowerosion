		<h3 class="header">slow erosion is the collaboration between Hannah Simmons and Sarah Fetterman.</h3>
		<p class="txt">They have developed a shared practice utilizing movement, sculpture, and technology through which they explore intangible and ephemeral states of being. Together, they develop a logical framework to unearth and preserve those things that are slippery, elusive; those things that are hard to hold, hard to name, harder yet to understand. Their process is careful and intricate, approaching these liminal states with a reverence, logic, and curiosity. They work to translate the ephemeral into artifact; to slow the process of disappearance; to keep a record of the residues that we leave. They try to understand: What is the substance of memory? Why is grief sinuous? What is the texture of a ghost? How heavy is loneliness? </p>
		<p class="txt">While conceptually, their work considers the same questions, they approach making from opposite perspectives. Simmons’ cerebral and algorithmic approach meets Fetterman’s material-oriented thought process. Their work grows through the conversation between materials and metaphysics. Living somewhere in between genres, they make work that is part dance, part sculpture, part interactive installation. Together, they create visually and intellectually striking works that tug at their viewers with a sort of nostalgia. Not a nostalgia for the past but, instead, for something that sidesteps time; something deeply ingrained within each of us, that has been felt but left unnamed.</p>

Their work has been shown at SOIL Gallery, Hybrid Architecture, and the Center on Contemporary Art. Their projects have been partially funded by the GAP Award (2017) and the CityArtist Grant (2018).</p>
